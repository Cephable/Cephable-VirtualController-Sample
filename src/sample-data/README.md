# Cephable Virtual Controller Sample Data

This folder contains json data of real user events from different types of requests and scenarios that your virtual controller might receive on behalf of the user including:
- Basic key presses
- Basic controller button presses
- Press and release events (latch/release)
- Mouse movement
- Joystick movement
- Multi-step macros
- Common game/app scenarios

You can use these json files to automate tests against your input system to process the events as if they were coming from Cephable's Device Hub without needing to have a full connection with the mobile app or other input sending real commands.
